# kill_termux  
A very stupid script that I run on termux will cause it to stop(exit) with any sort of warning ⚠️  

# Usage  
git clone https://github.com/pranav10780/kill_termux && cd kill_termux && chmod +x start.sh && ./start.sh    

# why does this exist?  
Just because this was fun to make and it can used in side of another file and stuff for trolling purposes
